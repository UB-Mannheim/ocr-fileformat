Convert between Tesseract hOCR and ALTO XML 2.0/2.1 using XSL stylesheets

This project provides an installation path and command line interface for
the stylesheets [developed by @filak](https://github.com/filak/hOCR-to-ALTO).

## Installation

To install system-wide to `/usr/local`:

```sh
sudo make install
```

To install without `sudo` to your home directory:

```sh
make install PREFIX=$HOME/.local
```

If `$HOME/.local/bin` is not in your `PATH`, add this to your shell startup file (e.g. `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`):

```
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin $PATH"
```

## Usage

## Transformation

### Command line interface

For now, try `ocr-transform -h` to get an overview.

### With an XSLT 2.0 processor

The stylesheets are installed in `$PREFIX/share/ocr-transform/xslt` and can be
used directly in your scripts and software. You will need to use an XSLT 2.0
capable stylesheet transformer.
